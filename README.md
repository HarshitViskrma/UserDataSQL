# User Data SQL

Handling user data using MySQL involves several key functionalities, including data insertion, retrieval, updating, and deletion while ensuring data security and integrity. First, a MySQL database is created with a structured schema to store user details such as id, name, email, password, and other relevant attributes. The user data is inserted using INSERT INTO queries, while retrieval is performed using SELECT statements, often with filters (WHERE clauses) to fetch specific user information efficiently. Updating user data is managed through UPDATE queries, and deleting records is handled using DELETE statements. To ensure data security, user passwords should be hashed using functions like bcrypt before storing them. Additionally, MySQL supports indexing to optimize query performance and transactions to maintain data consistency. Implementing proper access control, such as role-based authentication and limiting database privileges, enhances security. To prevent SQL injection, parameterized queries or prepared statements should be used. Regular backups and logging mechanisms help in monitoring and recovering data in case of failures.
